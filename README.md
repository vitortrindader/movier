## Getting started

Currently, the app is in development, so to use it, you will need to download the code and run both the API and frontend. To run the API, you will need to run the ```python server.py
``` command. To run the frontend, you will need to run ```npm run dev``` . Remember to download and add the csv files to the API directory (links below)

- movies
- scores

Add those files to the api directory so the app works; keep the names of the files

after that, the program should work just fine :)
